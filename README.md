Quick notes on the basic of computer science.
This repo contains my notes about the basic stuffs of computer science. This serves as quick self-reminder on computer science concepts


## Serialization / Deserialization
- Serialization is converting an object (in programming language) into byte string.
- this string can then be saved in in a file on a harddisk or transmitted over HTTP.
- Deserialization is constructing an object (in programming language) from a series of byte strings.

## Encoding / Decoding
- Encode converts string into byte
	- a = 'test'
	- encoded_a = 'test'.encode('utf8')
- Decode converts byte into string
	- b = b'test'
	- decoded_b = 'test'.decode('utf8')
- ASCII is example of 7-bit byte
- UTF-8 is example of 8-bit byte

## Difference between text file and binary file
- Similarity:
	- both text and binary file contains data based on series of bit
- Difference:
	- different in the way to interpret those bits
